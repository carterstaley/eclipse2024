	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	
	<p>On April 8th, 2024, the moon will pass directly in front of the
	sun and cast a shadow across North America. The path the shadow creates is called
	the path of totality. It will travel across Mexico, through Texas, over the
	midwest, finally ending over Maine and part of eastern Canada.
	
	<p>Eclipse 2024 is your one-stop-shop for everything you need to know to prepare
	yourself to view this once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.</p>

	<h2>What does it look like?</h2>
	
	
	<p>If you're in a viewing location that's in the path of totality, you will
	experience a total solar eclipse.</p>
	
	<p>Viewing the sun through special protective
	eyewear, you will see a disk slowly moving in front of the sun (that's the moon).
	As the moon moves to completely cover the sun, you will experience a few brief moments of totality.
	During this time, the sky will be come dark, insects will chirp, and you will be able to 
	view the corona of the sun with the naked eye like the image below.</p>
